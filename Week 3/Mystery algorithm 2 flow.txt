Flow of mystery 2 algorithm

1. stack is defined as empty list
2. Input is split into a list of words. Loop through words
	3. Series of checks occur looking for math operators +, -, * or /
		1. Check if stack is too small. Invalid Case 1 and end
		2. op1 and op2 are set to last 2 values in stack, respectively
		3. if + op then res = op1 + op2
		3. if - op then res = op1 - op2
		4. if * op then res = op1 * op2
		5. if op2 is 0, Invalid Case 2 and return none
		6. else / op is assumed and res = op1 / op2
		7. res is appended to end of stack
	4. Check if item selected is a float.
		* Append item to the end of stack as a float
	5. Check if item is nothing.
		* pass if true
	6. Else Invalid case 3. Return none
3. Check if stack has length of 1.
	* If not, Invalid case 4. Return none
4. Return sole item in stack.
