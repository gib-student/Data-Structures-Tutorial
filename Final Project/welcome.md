# Welcome
- Welcome to Trevor Gibb's tutorial to data structures! I 
will be touring you through three data structures: 
1. Queries
2. Linked Lists
3. Trees
- With every tutorial is included PDF documents which 
have clear explanations and diagrams, and a Python code
example and practice problem. Enjoy!
